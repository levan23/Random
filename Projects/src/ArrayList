/**
You are given n lines. In each line there are zero or more integers. You need to answer a few queries where you
need to tell the number located in y-th position of x-th line.

Input Format
The first line has an n integer . In each of the next n lines there will be an integer d denoting number of
integers on that line and then there will be d space-separated integers. In the next line there will be an integer
q denoting number of queries. Each query will consist of two integers x and y.

Output Format
In each line, output the number located in y-th position of x-th line. If there is no such position, just print
"ERROR!"
